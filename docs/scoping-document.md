# Wandertext

## Create and share semantically rich geospatial datasets.

## Dataset
  * a collection of events/instances/entries for which each has a geospatial
    component (reference to a place) and other, semantic information
    attached.

## Geospatial 
  * Related to the Earth and carrying a relationship to places on the Earth

## Semantically rich
  * Includes tagging that computers can’t do (yet/ever)
  * Slow, human-added information
  * Rich and generative in the tradition of literary criticism and close
    reading (in contrast to, for example, PoS tagging)

## Users

### Creator
  * Create “texts”
    * Something that has many references to one or more places
    * This could be a novel
    * Or a person’s life
    * Or a collection of recordings of people speaking their native languages
  * Create “entries”
    * Something in a text that refers to a single place at a single time.
  * Create “places”
    * Where entries happen, or what entries refer to
    * Should be (but doesn’t have to be?) a reference to a place in the “real
      world.”
    * Should be “geospatial enough” to aid in visualization on a map.

### Sharer / Viewer
  * Shares datasets
    * can download the geospatial data referring to a specific text
    * can access the geospatial data programmatically (such as through an
      API).
    * can view geospatial data for a specific text on the site itself in the
      form of web maps.
    * can mix and match datasets from different texts in the above three
      manners, as well.

### Manager (implicit persona)
  * Edits the site and data as a whole
  * Ensures the quality of the data or at least helps describe the data’s
    limitations.
  * Quality can include appropriate versioning, backups, etc.
  * Manages the creators (who are, of course, within the context of the
    application, represented by a table in the dataset as well).
